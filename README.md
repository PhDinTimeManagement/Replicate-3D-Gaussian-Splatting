# Note for replicating 3D Gaussian Splatting Repository

## submodules folder
- There are three modules
  - diff-gaussian-rasterization
    - Based on Cuda code (accelerated rust rising)
  - fussed-ssim
  - simple-knn
    - Used to determine the nearest Gaussian point

## Setup
- Clone the repository along with the submodules
  - `git clone https://github
